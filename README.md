#Code Map

A repo for my learning and to track progress for myself. It includes new tools I'm learning, tid-bits of information, and exciting ideas! Hopefully it ties together in some coherent way. It's a work in progress.

##Main themes
1. [Technical tools](/01-technical-tools) - languages, frameworks, libraries, tools.
2. [General information](/02-general-information) - computer science, history, how stuff works.
3. [Soft skills](/03-soft-skills) - facilitation, leadership, agile development, ethics, musings.
4. [Current events](/04-current-events) - what's hot in tech, who's who.
5. [Portfolio](/05-portfolio) - projects I've completed / am proud of.
