##Notes from "Javascript for Cats"

###Variables
* Values are the simplest components in Javascript
* Values include: `1`, `true`, `"hello"` `function(){}`
* Variables store Values

###Functions
* there are functions that modify or create values and return them and
functions take in values and perform some action that cannot be returned
* JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for ... in), and source code recovery (JavaScript programs can decompile function bodies back into their source text).
